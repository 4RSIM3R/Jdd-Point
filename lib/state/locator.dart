// Factory: When you request an instance of the type from 
//the service provider youâ€™ll get a new instance everytime. 
//Good for registering ViewModels that need to run the same logic 
// on start or that has to be new when the view is opened.

// Singleton: Singletons can be registered in two ways. 
//Provide an implementation upon registration 
// or provide a lamda that will be invoked the first time 
//your instance is requested (LazySingleton). The Locator 
//keeps a single instance of your registered type and will 
//always return you that instance.
